/**
 * Generation of host agent files from authored `@agent-profile` records (milestone generation-binding, task
 * generation-agent-profile; plan amendments C1, C5, C6 and C12). Each band-100 profile in the scope renders one claude
 * agent file, `.claude/agents/<profile name>.md`: YAML frontmatter naming the profile, describing it and listing the host
 * tools its capabilities allow, the packet's marker on its own line, then the profile's mandate bounds, voice, tools and
 * delegates, read from the records the profile's own fields reference. The Tools section lists the profile's capabilities
 * and every one they include (`composition.includes`); the frontmatter's tools are the profile's own capabilities'
 * effects, which the composition compiler holds as the ceiling of what each includes (review finding A-RC5).
 *
 * A profile is not rendered, and is reported as an unsupported row naming it and the reason, when its name is not a
 * portable host name, when its capabilities allow no host tool (claude reads an agent with no tool list as one given every
 * tool, so only a file left unwritten grants nothing), when the compiler would refuse its capability closure (an
 * inclusion cycle, or an included capability with effects its includer does not declare), or when its text, an authored
 * value's own or as rendered, is not inert prose. Codex renders none and reports
 * each: a codex agent needs an entry in `.codex/config.toml`, which holds the owned MCP block (C12). A profile below band
 * 100, an installed or adopted base, renders nothing, and no system steward does, a steward being an `@agent` (design
 * §4); a workspace that authors public systems, as this repository does, renders their profiles. The bytes are a function
 * of the scope's records alone: no absolute path, time or scope token is written.
 *
 * The mandate bounds are the profile's own `composition.mandate`. A profile that names none falls back to the authored
 * mandates C1 says bind its `composition.agent` (review finding A-R8): the agent a subagent acts as for edits the guard
 * selects (OD4), so the file states what the guard enforces; CLI commands independently choose a
 * workspace participant or steward. A participant-less mandate that states neither
 * scope nor covers locates nowhere and is left out (A-RC4). The fallback is resolved only for a rendered profile that
 * needs it, and a mandate C1 cannot read makes it unavailable, which the file says, never failing the render. A profile's
 * own mandate that names another participant is rendered with a line saying the guard does not judge this agent by it.
 *
 * Nothing applies these files yet: milestone generation-binding task host-consumes-generated-set hands them to the one
 * projection writer.
