/**
 * Generation of host skills from authored `@playbook` records (milestone generation-binding, task
 * generation-playbook-skill; plan amendments C6, C8 and C12). Each band-100 playbook in the scope renders one skill,
 * `.claude/skills/<playbook name>/SKILL.md` for claude and `.agents/skills/<playbook name>/SKILL.md` for codex, with the
 * same text for both: YAML frontmatter naming the playbook and describing it by its `meaning.says`, the packet's marker
 * on its own line, then one section per phase in the cycle order (orient, plan, act, learn) holding the playbook's
 * unconditional and conditional cells, the primary primitive's first. A phase with no cell is left out. A playbook
 * whose name is not a portable host name, that is named as the packet's own `ia-authoring` skill, or whose text is not
 * inert prose is not rendered, and is reported as an unsupported row naming it and the reason; the others still render.
 * A playbook below band 100, an installed or adopted base, renders nothing (C8, operator decision OD3: public and
 * adopted playbooks stay cells that `ia position` delivers), and a workspace that authors public systems, as this
 * repository does, renders their playbooks. The bytes are a function of the playbook's record alone: no absolute path,
 * time or scope token is written.
 *
 * Nothing applies these files yet: milestone generation-binding task host-consumes-generated-set hands them to the one
 * projection writer.
